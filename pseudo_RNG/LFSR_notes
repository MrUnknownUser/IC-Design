# Fibonacci LFSR
- https://gist.github.com/tzechienchu/bf698f51e406cfcc59238a9ceebe2827

- deterministic linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) generator
## Is it cryptographically strong / suitable for true entropy?
- No. An LFSR is linear and not cryptographically secure. It is fine for simple statistical randomness or Poisson-like event generation but not for security or high-quality entropy requirements.
## functionality
- https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/lfsr/index.html
- LFSR feedback polynomial?
- initialised with non-zero-state (0xAAAAAAAA)
  -	-> avoidance of all-zero-lockup issue (LSFR)
	- (nicht nur mit Nullen, da dann das Register aus diesem Zustand niemals herauskäme)
- https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_rückgekoppeltes_Schieberegister
- uses polynomial to create links between certain bits to fully cycle through the n-bit bytespace
- primitive polynomial is advised, to reduce period length
- xor spots at the exponent spots of polynomial

## advantages
- efficient implementation in hardware
- no doctorate required


## scale to 128-bit
- new generator polynomial
- densely populated polynomial preferred (higher computational cost than low amount of crossroads)
- ideally, use galois (preferred in hardware)
	- When implementing in FPGA/ASIC and you want higher clock frequency / lower LUT depth / better routing.
    - For very wide LFSRs or high-speed applications.
